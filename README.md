# kotlin_android_liquidplanner_client_example

An example application that explores building an Android client for LiquidPlanner using Kotlin. 

Disclaimer: Though I am an employee of LiquidPlanner, this is neither an official nor a supported application. It is the result of my enjoyment of Kotlin and wanting to see how it applied to mobile developemnt, now that it's an official language for Android.
